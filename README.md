# Health_Insurance_Project_SAS (Understanding how family size an arbitrary construct created by me drives health expenses)
- Ordinarily the project seeks to answer how people with or without kids spend money (health centric vs non-health centric)
- A comprehensive health insurance project done as a personal endeavor to understand insurance data given a failed interview with BCBS. 
- The project ended up being a part of the Biostatistics I course at UMKC.
- A few takebacks were some data coding issues when attempting to decouple a bimodal distribution for the Small Family Size Level (SFS) that led to the initial project producing some incorrect results.
- The project shared here has been corrected and should have no issues when it comes to drawing correct conclusions.
- Tests here are the Anova, Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-sq Goodness of Fit and Test of Association.
