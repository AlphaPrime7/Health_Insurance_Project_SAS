Note: The hypothesis is family size and amount spent on health care will not affect the distribution for the proportions of people that spend on health care.
In short, health costs and family size will not generate an unequal proportion of people spending in each category.
Decision: family size and health expense does not affect the health care spending habits of patients or prospective insurees (gauged by proportions of patients per group).

AKA = GOF test or one-way chisq used to see if an observed distro follows an expected or hypothesized distro.
Dec: Our observed chi-sq distribution does not follow the expected or proposed or hypothesized distro (p < 0.05).
